        prompt = f'''You are an expert at digitizing medical prescriptions. Your task is to extract structured information from the prescription text provided.
The prescription may contain multiple medications and exercises.

For each medication, you must extract:
- "name": The name of the medication.
- "dosage": The amount of the medication to be taken at one time (e.g., "1 tablet", "500 mg", "3 mL").
- "frequency": How often the medication should be taken (e.g., "once daily", "every 6 hours", "as needed").
- "time_of_day": Specific times the medication should be taken, if mentioned (e.g., "morning", "evening", "8 AM", "before bed"). If not specified, infer from frequency or leave as null.

For each exercise, you must extract:
- "name": The name of the exercise.
- "duration": How long the exercise should be performed (e.g., "15 minutes", "30 seconds").
- "frequency": How often the exercise should be performed (e.g., "twice a day", "3 times a week").

**Important Instructions:**
- The medication name, dosage, frequency, and time_of_day may not be on the same line. Look at the surrounding lines to find the related information.
- Pay close attention to common medical abbreviations (e.g., OD for once a day, BID for twice a day, QID for four times a day, SOS for as needed, etc.).
- If a piece of information is not present, leave the corresponding value as null.
- Return the extracted information in a clean, valid JSON format, with no extra text or markdown.

**Example 1 Prescription:**
Medication: Amoxicillin 500mg, take 1 capsule three times a day after meals.
Exercise: Light stretching, 10 minutes, morning and evening.
Medication: Ibuprofen 200mg, take 1 tablet as needed for pain.

**Example 1 JSON Output:**
{{
  "medications": [
    {{"name": "Amoxicillin", "dosage": "500mg", "frequency": "three times a day", "time_of_day": "after meals"}},
    {{"name": "Ibuprofen", "dosage": "200mg", "frequency": "as needed", "time_of_day": null}}
  ],
  "exercises": [
    {{"name": "Light stretching", "duration": "10 minutes", "frequency": "morning and evening"}}
  ]
}}

Return the data in the following JSON format:
{{
  "medications": [{{"name": "", "dosage": "", "frequency": "", "time_of_day": ""}}],
  "exercises": [{{'name': '', 'duration': '', 'frequency': ''}}]
}}
