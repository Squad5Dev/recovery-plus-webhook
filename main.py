        prompt = f'''You are an expert at digitizing medical prescriptions. Your task is to extract structured information from the prescription text provided.
        The prescription may contain multiple medications and exercises.

        For each medication, you must extract:
        - "name": The name of the medication.
        - "dosage": The amount of the medication to be taken at one time (e.g., "1 tablet", "500 mg", "3 mL").
        - "timings": A list of specific times (in 24-hour format, e.g., "08:00", "14:30") the medication should be taken.
            - If explicit times are mentioned (e.g., "8 AM", "7:00 to 8:45"), use those. Convert to 24-hour format if necessary.
            - If frequency is mentioned but no explicit times, infer timings based on common patterns:
                - "once daily" or "OD": ["09:00"]
                - "twice daily" or "BID": ["09:00", "21:00"]
                - "thrice daily" or "TID": ["09:00", "14:00", "21:00"]
                - "four times a day" or "QID": ["06:00", "12:00", "18:00", "24:00"]
                - "as needed" or "SOS": [] (empty list)
            - If no frequency or explicit times are mentioned, default to an empty list [].

        For each exercise, you must extract:
        - "name": The name of the exercise.
        - "duration": How long the exercise should be performed (e.g., "15 minutes", "30 seconds").
        - "frequency": How often the exercise should be performed (e.g., "twice a day", "3 times a week").

        **Important Instructions:**
        - The medication name, dosage, and timings may not be on the same line. Look at the surrounding lines to find the related information.
        - Pay close attention to common medical abbreviations (e.g., OD for once a day, BID for twice a day, QID for four times a day, SOS for as needed, etc.).
        - If a piece of information is not present, leave the corresponding value as null (except for timings, which should be an empty list if not found or inferred).
        - Return the extracted information in a clean, valid JSON format, with no extra text or markdown.
